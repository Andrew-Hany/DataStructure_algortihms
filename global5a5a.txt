Dynasty: mughals
barburname
name: barbur receiving a courtier
date:1580-1585
analysis:
you can see here that there are alot of people surrounding the ruler
you can feel the sence of the movement where some people are holding umberallas (i think ) and moving towards the leftof the painting, other are talking, someone who is standing up, so you can feel that you live the painting 
here, we can see a trial of the depth and prespective where you can feel that barbur( at the last level of the painting) and the other people in front of him, and those who are walking are behind of him, however it is not successfull as uit is not realistic
there is no emphasis on the faces, where the empahsis on the story of barbur
we can see that background is so beautiful architecture which make it so nice design and painting 
there are some people below in the painting baking or doing some work in an oven
the picture is so detailed

Notes:

-MS:Khamsa of Nizami

-Date:1481

-painter: Sultan Muhammad

-name:Bahram Gur in the White Pavillion

Analysis:

1)He is interested more in scene overall and the story itself so the faces are almost faceless
2)There is landscape which indicated that he shows the interior  and exterior space, but it is less realistic way that we have seen before
3)White background with famed designs with tem
●
4)Line drawing ( pencil like-color) in the white background in sophisim(not sure about the spelling of this thing ) are replaced here by a tree design on a white background
5)It is expressionistic which  means express what you want to say and what is written in the text, but you don’t show any thing naturalistic

 -court painter and chronicler Dust Muhammad wrote in his 1544 history of Persian Painting describing most probably this very painting. 

 Dust Muhammad.

-Painted by Sultan Muhammad. 

 -Ultimate integration of Bihzad’s Herati style into Turkoman tradition of painting 

- a new blend emerges and well balanced where the refinement of Herati with wilder, freer joyous palette of Turkoman style creating a balance between nature and man. 

-Sultan Muhammad excelled at it modifying his turko style apparent in earlier ‘Rustam sleeping’ Shah of Isma’il, to the  taste of the new Shah Tahmasp.(Canby, 79).

 - The king is at the apex and looks down at his son Siyamak.

-  Opposite on the other side is his other son Hushang.  The fantastic landscape imitates features found in the sleeping Rustam, but the spongy rocks have become more exuberant .  

-Attributed to Sultan Muhammad 

- it colors are vibrant 

- there snces of movemnt where there are people eotatoing or walking 

-the rocks are so unique and colorful

- clouds are chineese influence
