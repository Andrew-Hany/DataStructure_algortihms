My algorithm is 

1)first I did DFS
2)transpose to the graph 
3)third I did DFs to see which groups are connected

NOTe: I used the second example In the slide but by numbers 

A->0
B->1
C->2

And so on

So the answer should be

Group: { 11  }                                                                                                                          
Group: { 3 4 5 6  }                                                                                                                     
Group: { 7 8 9 10  }                                                                                                                    
Group: { 0 1 2  }
